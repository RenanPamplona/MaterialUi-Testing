# MaterialUi-Testing

In this repository, i just took a random material ui template and tried to reproduce it, without looking at the source code. <br></br>
The template I tried to copy was this one: https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/pricing/ <br></br>
I made this to learn more about material-ui and its components, as well as responsivity in it. That is the reason why the code is not organized in separate components or anything else, because I was just trying to play with it.
